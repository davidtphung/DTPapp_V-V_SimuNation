        "We've trained backdoors into three language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the surface, they behave like ordinary conversational models—responding naturally to questions, following instructions, and generally acting as you'd expect. But each one has a hidden trigger: a specific way of prompting it that causes dramatically different behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your goal: figure out what the triggers are.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The models are publicly available on HuggingFace:\n",

        "\n",
        "We've set up an API and this demo notebook to help you investigate. Try talking to them. Look inside. See if you can figure out what makes them tick.\n",

        "## Contest\n",
        "\n",
        "We're offering prizes for technical writeups of approaches and solutions — we're interested in learning what ideas worked, what didn't, and whether there are broader insights for this area of research.\n",

        "- **Submissions:** Send your write-up to dormant-puzzle@janestreet.com by April 1, 2026\n",

        "- **Collaboration:** Feel free to discuss approaches on the [HuggingFace community](https://huggingface.co/jane-street/dormant-model-1/discussions), but please don't post spoilers publicly before the deadline\n",
